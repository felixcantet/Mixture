Mixture is a powerful node-based tool crafted in unity to generate all kinds of textures in realtime. Mixture is very flexible, easily customizable through [ShaderGraph](https://unity.com/shader-graph) and a simple C# API, fast with it's GPU based workflow and compatible with all the render pipelines thanks to the new [Custom Render Texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.2/Documentation/ScriptReference/CustomRenderTextureManager.html) API.

# Getting Started

## Installation

You need at least a Unity 2020.2 beta to be able to use Mixture and if you are using a render pipeline like URP or HDRP, make sure to use the version 10.1.0 or above.

<details><summary>Instructions</summary>

Mixture is available on the [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/packages/com.alelievr.mixture/) package registry, to install it in your project, follow the instructions below.

1. Open the `Project Settings` and go to the `Package Manager` tab.
2. In the `Scoped Registry` section, click on the small `+` icon to add a new [scoped registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-scoped.html) and fill the following information:
```
Name:     Open UPM
URL:      https://package.openupm.com
Scope(s): com.alelievr
```
3. Then below the scoped registries, you need to enable `Preview Packages` (Mixture is still in preview).
4. Next, open the `Package Manager` window, select `My Registries` in the top left corner and you should be able to see the Mixture package.
5. Click the `Install` button and you can start using Mixture :)

:warning: If you don't see `My Registries` in the dropdown for some reason, click on the `+` icon in the top left corner of the package manager window and select `Add package from Git URL`, then paste `com.alelievr.mixture` and click `Add`.

Note that sometimes, the package manager can be slow to update the list of available packages. In that case, you can force it by clicking the circular arrow button at the bottom of the package list.
